        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          The Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on length, the
          inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special
          characters. It provides real-time feedback on the strength of your
          password, indicating whether it is very weak, weak, moderate, strong,
          or very strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to checking password strength, you can also compare your
          password against a list of commonly used passwords. If your password
          matches any entry in the list, it means your password is commonly used
          and could be easily cracked by attackers. For that you have to
          upload,which you can download from here
